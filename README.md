# NodeSynth
A nodal interface, written in Java, for creating synthesised instruments. It allows the user to combine basic waveforms in different ways in order to create unique sounds.

# Dependencies
 * Apache Ant - Required to build application using included shell scripts.
 
# Compiling
The shell script 'compile.sh' builds the application and produces an executable 'NodeSynth.jar' file.

The shell script 'run.sh' can then be used to run the application. Alternatively, 'updateAndRun.sh' automatically compiles and then runs the application.
